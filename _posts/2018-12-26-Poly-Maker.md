<p>
  Here is my new Poly Maker 2D tool that actually does nothing important and unfortunately doesn't change people's life. But! It was fun to write it and play with results. Inspired by "Poly Maker" tool written by Paul Lewis. I believe the original tool was written with JavaScripts and WebGL. As there were no sources, I decided to write my own real time version with Python and PyQt. The project is available here. So fork it, break it or improve it if you wish. Let's go!

I've never used my website as I was intending to. 10 years ago, when I was a student, I was thinking about a personal website with some blog and a gallery (I do CG stuff sometimes), contact page, terms of use, personal data base etc. And that's how I jumped into front-end web dev (and back-end after a few years). I did many things - I used Macromedia Flash, I did PNG pictures with colored words instead of using CSS "color" :D I gradually moved to what I call "Neither Seen Nor Recognized" (one of my favourite film with  Louis de Funes), that means "grab everything you can see from other websites' sources and use it on your own slightly changed". By doing that I studied JS, jQuery, HTML, CSS, php, mySQL, Flask and many other things. And you know what was funny? Again. I have never used my website as I intended to. Just because I didn't have enough content to show off. And I spent hundreds of US dollars just to get my website run being almost empty of any content all the time.

I think I did it because I was following the trend - <em>if you are a programmer or a CG artist - do some blog, post tutorials, be like everyone, and even better - get some youtube channel. Doesn't matter if there are hundreds or thousands of people posting just the same beginner thing all the time. Do it as well.</em> I see it happening all the time. But I didn't post too many tutorials as I knew that it should be something that is totally mine. My own thing. My own projects. That nobody will find anywhere but my website.

<p>Take into account that during the last year (now it's 2018 on my side. If it's 2027 on your side - find me and ask me delete this article) I didn't have anything on my website but the "About" page. Mostly for people who somehow got lost on the Internet and found my website, entering weird characters on their keyboard by head because there is nothing left they haven't seen yet and they are bored.</p>
